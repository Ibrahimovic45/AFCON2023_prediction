“I want to win the competition” was the clear message from Mohamed Salah about his ambitions at AFCON as he departed Premier League leaders Liverpool.

Egpyt’s place among the favourites rests solely on the shoulders of Africa’s best – and arguably greatest ever – footballing talent.

Salah helped the Reds end a 30-year wait for a league title as well as helping them to a seventh Champions League trophy.

Despite his overwhelming club success, the forward’s commitment to his country is unwavering but he will need to inspire all the support he can get – from a team that is far from star-studded – if the king is to achieve the crowning glory of an AFCON title.

Mohamed Elneny a bit-part midfielder at Arsenal and Al Ittihad’s Ahmed Hegazy is the other name of note.



Egypt can, however, point to their appearance in the final of the last tournament – and their route to reach the showpiece game after overcoming Ivory Coast, Morocco and Cameroon.

A glittering past for Egypt, a glittering present for Salah but can the two combine to fulfil the dreams of the Pharoah’s greatest footballer?

Denied a shot at the World Cup but a play-off eliminator and denied twice in the 2017 and 2022 AFCON finals, the clock is ticking for the 31-year-old and his place in his country’s history books.
